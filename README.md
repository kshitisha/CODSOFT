Summary 

This project demonstrates a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. The chatbot uses if-else statements to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This basic implementation helps understand natural language processing and conversation flow.

How It Works


The chatbot identifies user inputs using predefined rules and responds accordingly:

If the user greets with "hello", the chatbot responds with a greeting.

If the user asks about "AI", the chatbot provides the full form of AI.

If the user asks about the "meaning of life", the chatbot responds with a philosophical statement.

For any other queries, the chatbot provides a default response.



Implementation


The chatbot is implemented in Python using a simple function chatbot_response which processes user inputs and returns appropriate responses based on predefined rules.
